# Welcome
> The **Suitability** tool identifies optimal locations for a specific activity within a city. To simplify the decision making process the tool maps multiple variables in one single index. To create such index, users can select layers and create maps in minutes. Additionally, they can define their own normalization rules, assign weights to each layer and filter the dataset to redefine their study area. 

Evidence based decision making depends on data availabilty and robust assessment methods. Local governments commonly face challenges in gathering, organizing, standardizing and analyzing data. Decision makers commonly depend on expensive licensed software and trained personnel to organize and analyze spatial information. Once that the assessment is complete, they face several communication challeges: they need to present and discuss their findings with peers, communicate efficiently with stakehlders and frequently, make adjustments to their proposals. The whole process might take months or even years to complete. 

With the tool decision makers and practitioners can perform agile assessments in urban environments to map infrastructure gap hotspots, identify the optimal location for urban services and housing projects or to understand the overall distribution of a specific variable across the city. 

The tool is highly intuitive, can be accessed online and includes a comprehensive spatial dataset. This is highly relevant, because decision makers can focus on analyzing data and making informed decisions, as opposed to spending time and resources in searching and downloading data, paying and installing software and spending hours in learning how to use it. 

Suitability is an open source tool, which allows full customization and ensures total transparency in calculation methods and data sources. 

The **Suitability** tool simplifies the process of spatial data analysis and communication. It can be used by individuals or by groups to make informed choices in the spatial planning process.

## How to use the tool
To use the tool follow the next steps:

1. **Open** the following address in your web browser  [www.suitability.in](http://www.suitability.in). 
2. **Select the city** you want to analyze. 
3. **Select the layer(s)** that you want to include in your analysis and visualize the results in the map.

Optionaly, users can: 

* Select *filters* to redefine the study area. 
* Select different *astethics* such as base map, transparency and subsetting areas within a range of *index* values.
*  Modify *settings* for normaization and weighting methods. 
*  *Download* raw, preprocessed or processed data for fourther analysis.

The following video presents a comprehensive tour to all functionalities in the tool. 

## Technical
**Suitability** is an open source tool developed in [R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) version 3.4.4 and package [Shiny: Web Application Framework for R](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) version 1.1.0. **Suitability** was designed as a web application. This implies that users do not need to download or install software. They can access the tool via web browser –including Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Firefox–, in their preferred operating system –including Windows, Mac and Linux– and in a desktop, laptop or tablet. 

Users can run a desktop version as well. This alternative was mainly designed for advanced users who depend on more complex assessments. To test the desktop version users need to install and have a basic understanding of [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
