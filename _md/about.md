About City Planning Labs
=======================

Indonesia is undergoing a rapid transformation, ranking among the top ten fastest urbanizing countries in the world. However, it has not benefited fully from the expected positive returns
of urbanization that other countries in the region have experienced. Policy and governance reforms have also not been accompanied by marked improvements in the quality of services.
In addition, increase in local government spending has not yielded expected results in service delivery. Among other things, this is attributable to medium and long-term city planning not being adequately informed by rigorous analytics that combine multi-sectoral inputs. Such gaps in planning, implementation and regulatory frameworks have serious implications resulting in unplanned urban sprawl that stretches the carrying capacity of its cities to a breaking point. As Indonesia strides into an urban century, sustainable growth and careful spatial planning of cities is the need of the hour.

The World Bank is supporting the Government of Indonesia to develop a programmatic response to the challenges of sustainable urbanization. City Planning Labs (CPL) is one such Technical Assistance initiative that supports municipal governments to build capacity for data-driven planning, which in turn will create smart, inclusive, and sustainable cities.

It enables this through the development of institutional data sharing platforms and local government capacity building for utilizing data within urban planning functions. It also helps cities analyze the patterns of urban growth and develop planning tools that study growth trends to support implementation of city-level strategic planning documents, such as the spatial and sectoral development plans.
