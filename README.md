Suitability is a Shiny App which identifies optimal locations for a specific activity within a city. It does so by evaluating the current status of neighbourhoods across the city, based on the availability of infrastructure, urban equipment and the distance to services and amenities. The tool is based on geographical information systems and multi-criteria analysis. It is flexible and adaptable to different resolutions.
